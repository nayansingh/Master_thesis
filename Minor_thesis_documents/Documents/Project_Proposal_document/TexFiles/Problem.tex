\section{Problem}
The process of detecting objects and patterns in live video sequence is a challenging task. The occurrence of brand logos in different size, shape, rotation angle, skewness and due to presence of occlusion \footnote{In all rendering algorithms there is a chance of creating holes that cannot be reconstructed in the computed images, or overlapping pixels that cannot be interpreted. This phenomenon is defined as occlusion \cite{Depth6:online}.} effects makes the detection of brand logos in a input video stream a daunting task. But there is a dire need of automating the process of brand logo detection and measurement of effectiveness of the same in video sequences. The reason is due to the fact that manual detection and characterization of brand logo in live video sequence is an arduous and error prone task. One more reason is that by automating the task of brand logo detection in live video stream or in humongous amount of stored movie data a lot of human effort can be avoided.  


\section{Problem Statement}
  There is a need for an application that determines the effectiveness of brand logo in a video sequence. This information is used by the companies to understand the effectiveness of the brand logo as viewed by the target audience.To be precise the problem that will be addressed in this project is \\ \\ 
  {\it "To detect and measure effectiveness of brand logo of a company in a video sequence, as viewed by the viewers in real time."}
